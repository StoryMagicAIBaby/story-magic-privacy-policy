Privacy Policy for Story Magic AI
Effective Date: [October 6, 2025]

1. Introduction
Welcome to Story Magic AI ("we," "our," "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and the privacy of your children. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

2. Information We Collect
We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us when you create a profile within the App. This includes:

Profile Information: Child's name or nickname, age range, and chosen avatar.

Personalization Details: Information you provide to personalize stories, such as favorite animal, favorite toy, favorite color, and the names of family members or friends (e.g., siblings, parents, grandparents).

We do not collect personal information automatically. We do not use tracking cookies or collect device IDs for advertising purposes.

3. How We Use Your Information
The information we collect is used solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's core functionality. Specifically, we use your information to:

Generate Personalized Stories: The profile and personalization details are sent to a third-party AI service (OpenAI) to generate a unique story for your child.

Save and Manage Profiles: Your created profiles are saved so you can easily access them for future story creation.

Save Stories: Generated stories are saved and associated with a profile so you can read them again later.

4. Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party services to operate our App:

OpenAI: We send the personalization details (child's name, age, favorites, etc.) to OpenAI's API to generate the story content. We do not control OpenAI's data handling practices. You can review their privacy policy for more information.

Amazon Web Services (AWS): All profile information and saved stories are stored securely on servers provided by AWS DynamoDB.

We do not share your information with any other third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.

5. Data Storage and Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information. All data is stored in a secure cloud database (AWS DynamoDB). However, no electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Children's Privacy
Our App is intended for use by parents and guardians to create stories for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without parental consent. The information entered into profiles is provided by the parent or guardian. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.

7. Your Rights
You have the right to access, update, or delete the profiles and stories you have created at any time directly within the App. Deleting a profile will also delete all stories associated with it from our database.

8. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App or on our app store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
